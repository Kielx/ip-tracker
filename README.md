## Overview

The project was a challenge from [IP Tracker](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).
It was yet another challenge to solidify my external API usage, responsive layout, and React skills.

### The challenge

The challenge consisted of three external API's usage, state management, responsive layout all wrapped in a single-page React App. User stories that needed to be fulfilled:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
